This repository contains the analysis scripts (R Markdown files) used in the paper. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and spatial transcriptomics data have been analysed in R (v4.1.0) using two different sets of scripts and have been named as follows:
* Bulk RNA-sequencing data analysis: bulk_processingcode.Rmd (file)
* Spatial transcriptomics data analysis: spatial_processingcode (folder)
